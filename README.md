# homework7
created a ReadME.Md using node index.js with all the necesary requirments
I had run into trouble making the table of contents and the spacing of the document.
However I still created and implemented proper techiniques to satisify a majority of the challenges requirements.
If I had to change anything it would be my spacing betweeen sentences but I am happy with my product
Aquired helped from a tutor session and TA that really helped finalize my product.
Thank you and cheers.
